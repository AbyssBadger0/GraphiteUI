# Progress Log

## Session: 2026-04-28 Round 3

### Phase 1: Re-orientation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran planning session catchup and read the completed round 2 plan/progress.
  - Confirmed the worktree starts clean on `main...origin/main`.
  - Inspected `statePortCreateModel.ts`, its tests, and `NodeCard.vue` port draft handlers.

### Phase 2: Select Safe Refactor Slice
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Selected state port create draft update helpers as the next low-risk cleanup slice.
  - Decided to keep create commit validation and translated error messages in `NodeCard.vue` for now.

### Phase 3: Implement Cleanup
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added state port draft helper tests first and verified they failed because the exports did not exist.
  - Added immutable draft helper functions to `statePortCreateModel.ts`.
  - Updated `NodeCard.vue` port draft handlers to call the model helpers.

### Phase 4: Verification
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran `statePortCreateModel.test.ts` after implementation.
  - Ran `NodeCard.structure.test.ts`.
  - Ran focused state port create and NodeCard tests together.
  - Ran `npx vue-tsc --noEmit --noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters`.
  - Ran the full frontend node test suite.
  - Ran the frontend production build.
  - Restarted the local dev environment with root `npm run dev`.
  - Confirmed the frontend returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:3477`.
  - Confirmed the backend health route returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/health`.

### Phase 5: Commit and Push
- **Status:** in_progress
- Actions taken:
  - Checked git status after restart; only source/planning changes are visible, no runtime logs or build output are staged.

## Test Results
| Test | Input | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| Red test | `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/statePortCreateModel.test.ts` before implementation | Fails because new helper exports are missing | Failed with missing `updateStatePortDraftColor` export | Passed |
| State port create model | `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/statePortCreateModel.test.ts` | Model tests pass | 7 passed | Passed |
| NodeCard structure | `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/NodeCard.structure.test.ts` | Structure constraints pass | 34 passed | Passed |
| Focused frontend tests | `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/statePortCreateModel.test.ts frontend/src/editor/nodes/NodeCard.structure.test.ts` | Touched surface tests pass | 41 passed | Passed |
| Unused symbol check | `npx vue-tsc --noEmit --noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters` in `frontend` | No unused-symbol diagnostics | Exit 0, no diagnostics | Passed |
| Full frontend tests | `node --test $(rg --files frontend/src -g '*.test.ts') frontend/vite.config.structure.test.ts` | All frontend tests pass | 669 passed | Passed |
| Frontend production build | `npm run build` in `frontend` | Build succeeds | Exit 0 with existing large chunk warning | Passed |
| Dev restart | `npm run dev` | Services start and respond | Frontend 200, backend `/health` 200 | Passed |

## Error Log
| Timestamp | Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-----------|-------|---------|------------|
| 2026-04-28 | `StateFieldType` missing after import cleanup | `npx vue-tsc --noEmit --noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters` | Restored the type-only import in `NodeCard.vue`. |

## 5-Question Reboot Check
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where am I? | Commit and push phase. |
| Where am I going? | Review diff/status, commit with a Chinese message, and push. |
| What's the goal? | Continue reducing NodeCard concentration without changing editor behavior. |
| What have I learned? | `statePortCreateModel.ts` already owns create-port draft behavior and is the right place for draft patch helpers. |
| What have I done? | Extracted state port draft helpers, fixed one type import issue, and ran focused checks. |
